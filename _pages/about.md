I am a postdoc associate in the [Computational bioinformatics, Bioimage, Machine learning](https://github.com/cbil-vt), Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), VA, USA, working with [Prof. Yue (Joseph) Wang](https://ece.vt.edu/people/profile/wangy.html) on the intersection of AI/ML and medical data processing. Before that, I was a postdoc associate at [Cornell University](https://mosadeghlab.weebly.com) working on AI/ML in medical imaging, and at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://mehdimirakhorli.github.io) conducting research in the intersection of ML and software security. I received my Ph.D. in Information Technology Engineering from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) in 2022 with a focus on AI/ML and medical imaging. In particular, my dissertation aimed at pushing the boundary of program synthesis and supporting a wide range of software developers with inter-procedural program synthesis.

My [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678705) on program synthesis is the **First-place Award Winner** of the Research Competition at the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ([ASE’21](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2021)).

During my Ph.D., as a Research Intern, I had the privilege to collaborate with brilliant researchers at [Google](http://www.google.com) (Fall 2022) and [PARC](https://www.parc.com) (Spring 2022).
