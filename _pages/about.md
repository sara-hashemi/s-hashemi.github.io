I am a postdoc associate in the [Systems Software Research Group](https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/), Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/), VA, USA, working with [Prof. Binoy Ravindran](https://binoyravindran.github.io/) on the intersection of security, program analysis, and formal methods. I received my Ph.D. in Computing and Information Sciences from [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://rit.edu/), NY, USA, in 2023, under the supervision of [Dr. Mirakhorli](http://www.se.rit.edu/~mehdi/) with the focus on program synthesis and program analysis. In particular, my dissertation aimed at pushing the boundary of program synthesis and supporting a wide range of software developers with inter-procedural program synthesis.

My [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678705) on program synthesis is the **First-place Award Winner** of the Research Competition at the 36th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ([ASE’21](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2021)).

During my Ph.D., as a Research Intern, I had the privilege to collaborate with brilliant researchers at [Google](http://www.google.com) (Fall 2022) and [PARC](https://www.parc.com) (Spring 2022).
